# StayYatra ✈️🏡
## About this project 
this project is fully on backend logic . i made this project to learn, to understand more about backend . <br>
The project focuses on handling user sessions, data management, and server-side logic rather than frontend design.
<br>
this project is demo learning project which inspired by airbnd ( the famous online marketplace/app used to book short- and long-term stays ) .
in this website we should see same features but lesser amount because it is learning project .
<br><br>
## project purpose 
The main goal of StayYatra is to:
<ul>
  <li>Practice backend development using Node.js and Express</li>
  <li>Work with databases and CRUD operations</li>
  <li>Understand session-based authentication</li>
  <li>Learn how real projects are structured and deployed</li>
</ul>

This is not a UI-heavy project. The focus is on logic, flow, and backend functionality.

## Tech Stack

Node.js – runtime environment

Express.js – backend framework

MongoDB – database

Mongoose – MongoDB object modeling

EJS – templating (minimal frontend)

Bootstrap – basic styling

## Project Type

Backend-focused project

No advanced frontend features like search or filters (note- because of limited listings )

Designed mainly for learning server-side development

## Deployment
The project is deployed online. Since it is hosted on a free backend hosting service, the server may take some time to respond on the first request.<br>
